### Abstract
Binary classification is a fundamental problem in data science and machine learning. The objective of this project was to build an MLOPs piepline for a model that predicts hotel reservation cancellations. 

Here I simulate and MLOPs workflow that supports the training and prediction pipeline, utilizing the tuned XGB model obtained from the data science offline experimentation. The MLOPs pipeline is comprised of three stages: preprocessing (Imputer and Encoder) with adjustable feature parameters for training and prediction, training and evaluation with configurable threshold logic and evaluation metrics, and prediction on the entire dataset using the latest promoted model.

Keywords: Binary Classification, XGBoost, Class Imbalance, MLOPs Pipeline.
